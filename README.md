# CAPPP-Research-Fellowship-Portfolio: Covid-19 Twitter Misinformaotion and Public Trust
This repository contains most of my data and code used in my Center for American Politics and Public Policy research fellowship. For this fellowship I am researching how exposure to potential COVID-19 misinformation on Twitter has affected public trust. The "Twitter data" folder contains some of the tweet ID's I rehydrated using the Twitter API in R in addition to the code I used to do so. The "trust and control variables" folder contain all the transformations of the data I have had for my control variables and dependent variable, trust. This folder also has the code I created for wrangling my data. The "R assignments" folder has some homework assignments that I have completed throughout the program that develop programming skills that I will and have used independently with my own research project.
