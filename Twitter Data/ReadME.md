This repository contains most of the code that I used when collecting tweets. Per the data use agreement that I signed, I am unable to share or upload most of the Twitter data that I collected from the Center of an Informed Public (CIP), which is where I ended up collecting all my twitter data. However, before I gained access to the CIP database, I collected around 500,000 coronavirus tweets that had already been classified by researchers on GitHub as true or false. So, I have shared the code that I used to connect to the twitter API to rehydrate the tweet IDs along with the links to the GitHub databases with the tweet IDs.
